"""The write-time attribution guard: no write may replace a populated slot's
stored backup with a different account's bytes.

Incident (2026-09-07): an unverified switch-time claim (an identity file's
account number, never itself confirmed against the roster) let account N's
live credential get written under slot M's key. The pin later consumed slot
N's grant while it believed it held slot M's, the server killed that
generation, and the account read as needing a fresh login inside its
documented 30-day grace window.

The check itself is ``CredentialStore._check_attribution``, shared by the
main chokepoint (``CredentialStore._write_account_credentials``, reached by
every caller directly or via the switcher's own ``_write_account_credentials``
wrapper) and by the two backend-only forwarders the switcher exposes for the
macOS-keyring-to-security migration's Keychain-only write
(``switcher.py``'s ``_kc_write_backup``/``_write_backup_enc``, PR 210 round 5
— these used to be a straight, unguarded pass-through to the store's raw
backend writers, which is exactly how ``migrations.py`` reached the Keychain
unattributed). Either path refuses to replace a *populated* slot's stored
backup with a different OAuth lineage (a differing
``oauth.credential_fingerprint``, or a backup that could not be read at all —
"unreadable" refuses like a mismatch, never permits like absent) unless the
caller attests ``attributed=True`` — an explicit, per-call-site claim that it
independently verified the new bytes belong to that slot (a uuid-verified
identity resolution, or a structural move/rotation of that same account's own
record). A first-ever write into an empty slot has nothing stored to
contradict it and is never refused by this alone.

Two tests below DERIVE their subject from the AST rather than naming it, per
the project's own lesson that a container-level or member-listing check goes
blind the day a new member (a new writer, or a new backend call) is added
without review:

- ``TestBackendWritersHaveExactlyOneCaller`` walks EVERY module under
  ``src/claude_swap`` (not just ``credentials.py`` — a single-file scan is
  blind to a caller anywhere else in the package) for every call to the two
  backend writers and asserts each one is textually inside a known guard —
  the guard cannot be routed around by a new private method that reaches the
  Keychain or the ``.enc`` file directly.
- ``TestWriteSiteRosterIsReviewed`` walks EVERY module under
  ``src/claude_swap`` (not three named files — a hand-named list is blind to
  a caller in a module nobody named) for every call into the write
  chokepoint and asserts the derived (file, enclosing function) roster
  matches exactly what this round reviewed — a new call site (or a second
  call added to an existing one, in ANY module) changes the count and fails
  the test, forcing the same review this round gave the other twenty.

# write chokepoint, in a module #210 does not touch, so it cannot go in
# EXPECTED_WRITE_SITE_ROSTER above — that roster must match exactly on THIS branch,
# where the site does not exist. Reviewed here so the review happens ONCE, in the PR
# that owns the guard, instead of refusing every rebuild.
#
#   credentials.py::_read_account_credentials — PR 286's converge write: after a bare
#   renumber it mirrors the newest-generation backup found under another slot number
#   back under this account's own number (same email, confirmed against the roster;
#   the source slot is never deleted). NOT admitted with attributed=True: it is a write
#   taken from inside a read that the write path's own verification reaches, so PR 286
#   suppresses it for a verification read (CredentialStore._in_attribution_read).
#
#   switcher.py::_register_login_as_new_slot/_adopt_login_into_slot/
#   _adopt_stashed_login_for_slot/_adopt_into_dead_slot — PR 199's bare-login-heals-
#   its-slot engine tick, in functions this round never saw. Each writes only after
#   independently matching the live login's identity against the roster (the
#   `attributed=True` comment at each call site names which read established it) —
#   admitted with attributed=True.
